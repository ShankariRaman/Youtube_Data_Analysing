# YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing

## Overview

This project focuses on harvesting data from YouTube using the YouTube API and storing it in both MongoDB and SQL databases. 
The collected data includes information about channels, videos, and comments. Additionally, the project demonstrates data analysis and visualization using SQL queries and Streamlit.

## Key Steps

   - Obtained a YouTube API key.
   - Utilized Python to scrape data from YouTube, including channel details, videos, and comments.

2. **Data Storage:**
   - Stored the collected data in MongoDB for initial storage.

3. **Data Migration to SQL:**
   - Created SQL tables (Channel, Video, Comment) to store the data.
   - Migrated data from MongoDB to SQL for structured querying.

4. **SQL Queries:**
   - Developed SQL queries to answer 10 specific questions related to the collected data.

5. **Streamlit Visualization:**
   - Utilized Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface for visualizing results.
   - Displayed information such as channel details, video statistics, and query results.
